# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Paul Amat. I'm a senior UX Designer, Researcher and Data Analyst.

Since 7 years I use knowledge from social sciences to create designs that focus on userâ€™s needs and business objectives. I work closely with data analysts and use tools such as R and MAXQDA to uncover insights that inform designs. I work from Paris.
